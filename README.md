# python-asyncio

A collection of attempts to grasp coroutines in Python :-)

- `asyncio-procwatch.py` shows how to watch the output of multiple subprocesses line-by-line.
- `asyncio-filewatch.py` shows how to watch multiple files that other processes append to. (Classical log-watching
  scenario.)
